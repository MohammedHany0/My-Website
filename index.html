      <h2>About myself </h2>
      <p> My name is Mohamed Hany Al-Hour</p> 
      <p> am 20 years old, IT student at Palestine University</p>
      <p> I am interested in developing myself and my skills in the technical field, especially, because it was my passion from the beginning, and I see that it has become everything now, so I always strive to develop it, especially in professional and pioneering environments like Gaza sky geek's, and I follow a lot of all your training camps and I want to have a place In it with my skills, I am still a student and an expert in the field, but I am looking forward to getting this training to develop what I have to the point of professionalism, and pouring my efforts into a strong environment and the ability to launch into the world of self-employment with an understanding and a vision with a dimension of this world.</p>

      <h3>Why do I want to join this program ? </h3>
      <p>The most important thing I want is to get a free online job as a source of income for me and launch into the working world with full awareness of websites, business presentation and dealing with clients.</p>
      <p> Of course, getting out of this academy successfully would do a lot for me on a personal level, such as professionalizing the field, learning and benefiting from the experiences of coaches and colleagues, and on a social level, from getting to know people. The same interest and learning from what others have in the field.</p>
